#1	Split the list of words on AND_OR or OR_IF, if needed. Last token type of that list
of commands will be END.

#2	After splitting the list, I need to check for HERE-DOC and remove the DLESS operator
and the HERE DOC nodes, after I prompt a readline to gather user input. After I get user
input I make a new node that will hold the input.

#3	Expansion needs some more work. I need to replace all the u_int32_t to ssize_t, because
I dont have a way to distinguish errors while reading the string and allocating some space
for it.

#4 Make a separate directory for all free functions.....
